    Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) Safety Cage.
    
    This class implements a simple safety cage based on maximum softmax probability thresholding
    for detecting uncertain predictions in neural network classifiers. The approach flags predictions
    as potentially incorrect when the maximum softmax probability falls below a specified threshold.
    
    The method is based on the research presented in:
    Hendrycks, D., & Gimpel, K. (2016). A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and 
    Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks. arXiv:1610.02136.
    
    Attributes:
        train_cage_data (tuple): Stores training data (x,y) used to train the safety cage
        model_module: Reference to model module object for making predictions
    
    Methods:
        train_cage: Stores training data for the safety cage
        predict: Computes statistical metrics on input data
        _compute_statistics: Calculates maximum softmax probabilities
        flag: Identifies uncertain predictions based on probability threshold
