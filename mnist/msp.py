    Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) Safety Cage Method.
    
    This class implements a simple safety cage based on maximum softmax probability thresholding
    for detecting uncertain predictions in neural network classifiers. The approach flags predictions
    as potentially incorrect when the maximum softmax probability falls below a specified threshold. Hence,
    the method works for any classifier that outputs class probabilities, not just neural networks.
